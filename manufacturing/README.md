## Production Scaling Levels

As mentioned in the main README, this project supports four levels of production scaling:

1. **Prototype** (1 unit): Development board and breadboard setup
2. **Small Batch** (10-50 units): Hand assembly of custom PCB
3. **Medium Scale** (50-500 units): PCB assembly service
4. **Large Scale** (500+ units): Full-scale manufacturing with automated testing

## File Versioning

All manufacturing files use semantic versioning and are tagged with hardware revision numbers.

## Getting Started

1. Review the PCB specifications in `pcb/specifications/`
2. Check the latest BOM in `bom/`
3. Follow assembly instructions in `assembly/`
4. Use test procedures in `testing/` for quality assurance

## Manufacturing Partners

This design is compatible with:
- Standard PCB manufacturers (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park)
- Common assembly services
- Domestic US manufacturers for local production

## Compliance

All designs target FCC Part 15, CE marking, and RoHS compliance. See `regulatory/` for details.
