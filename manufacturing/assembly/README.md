## Quick Start Guides

### For Prototype/Development (1-5 units)
1. Start with `hand_assembly/step_by_step_guide.md`
2. Review `safety_and_esd/esd_protection.md`
3. Follow component placement in `visual_aids/pcb_layout_diagrams/`
4. Use `troubleshooting/` if issues arise

### For Small Batch Production (10-50 units)
1. Review `small_batch/batch_assembly_guide.md`
2. Set up fixtures per `small_batch/fixture_setup.md`
3. Implement QC procedures from `small_batch/quality_control.md`
4. Scale processes as volume increases

### For Medium Scale Production (50-500 units)
1. Transition to `small_batch/` procedures
2. Consider automated stencil printing
3. Implement statistical process control
4. Prepare for automation transition

### For Large Scale Production (500+ units)
1. Follow `automated_assembly/automation_guidelines.md`
2. Set up pick & place and reflow systems
3. Implement automated testing procedures
4. Use production equipment specifications

## Assembly Complexity Levels

### Level 1: Basic Hand Assembly
- Through-hole components only
- Basic soldering skills required
- Minimal equipment needs
- Suitable for makers and prototyping

### Level 2: Mixed Technology Assembly
- SMT and through-hole components
- Intermediate soldering skills
- Microscope and fine-tip iron required
- Quality control checkpoints

### Level 3: Production Assembly
- Full SMT with fine-pitch components
- Professional equipment required
- Automated assembly preferred
- Statistical quality control

## Quality Standards

All assembly procedures target:
- **IPC-A-610 Class 2** workmanship standards
- **Zero defect** assembly for critical connections
- **100% functional test** pass rate
- **Minimal rework** requirements

## Version Control

Assembly instructions are version controlled and match:
- PCB revision numbers
- Firmware compatibility
- Component specifications
- Quality standards

## Safety First

⚠️ **Always review safety procedures before beginning assembly:**
- ESD protection procedures
- Chemical safety (flux, solvents)
- Tool safety (soldering irons, hot air)
- Ventilation requirements

## Support and Training

- Video tutorials (coming soon)
- Training materials for technicians
- Certification procedures for assemblers
- Technical support contact information

## Contributing

Assembly procedure improvements and feedback are welcome:
1. Document any assembly issues encountered
2. Suggest process improvements
3. Submit photos of successful assemblies
4. Report any safety concerns
