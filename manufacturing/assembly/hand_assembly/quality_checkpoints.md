# Quality Checkpoints - Hand Assembly

## Overview
This document defines quality control checkpoints throughout the hand assembly process for ESP Sensor Hub units. Each checkpoint includes specific inspection criteria, acceptance standards, and corrective actions.

## Quality Philosophy

### Prevention vs. Detection
- **Prevention**: Build quality into the process

### Quality Standards
- **IPC-A-610 Class 2**: General electronic products standard
- **Zero defects**: Goal for critical safety and functionality
- **First-pass yield**: Target >95% without rework
- **Customer satisfaction**: Meet or exceed expectations
